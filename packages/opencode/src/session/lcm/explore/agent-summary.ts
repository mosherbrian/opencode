## Instructions

1. Use the Read tool to examine the file at "${input.filePath}"
2. If needed, use Grep to search for specific patterns
3. Understand the file's purpose, structure, and how it fits into the codebase
4. Provide a concise summary (300-800 tokens) that explains:
   - What this file does and why it exists
   - Key components and their purposes
   - How it relates to other parts of the system
   - Notable patterns or important details

Write your summary in clear prose. Use actual names from the code. Don't reproduce code - describe what it does.`
